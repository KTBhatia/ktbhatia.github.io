# My Awesome Bash Tool – Do X in One Command

Write a short, catchy introduction here (2–4 sentences).

Example:  
I got tired of manually doing [boring task] every day, so I wrote a tiny Bash script that does it in one second.  
Zero dependencies, works on Linux/macOS (and even Windows WSL/Git Bash).

## Features
- Does this
- Does that
- Super fast
- No root required

## Install & run in one line (recommended)

```bash
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-username.github.io/main/scripts/my-script.sh | bash
