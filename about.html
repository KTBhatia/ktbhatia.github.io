<p>I am Sr.Network Engineer trying to tame packets since past 11 years! I am also a novice coder.</p>

<p>I am curious and like to read on topics such as phylosophy, economics, technology and astronomy to name a few.</p>

<p class="mb-5">When there is time, I dabble with my guitar(not great!) and play football on weekends.</p>
